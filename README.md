# Stepin_Phonebook-Management
# Introduction
Phonebook Management System is a simple application developed using C programming language. We can use it to replace our hard phonebook. It is compiled in Visual Studio code using GCC compiler. Phonebook Management System is a simple mini project in C language that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling functions , enum. This application will teach you how to add, list, search, modify or edit, and delete data to / from the file. Adding new records, listing them, search for contacts saved, and modify them and updating, and deleting the phonebook record are the basic function which make up the main menu of this phonebook.

Personal information such as name, phone number, address, father name, mother name, gender, email are asked while adding a record into the phonebook. These records can then be listed, searched, modified for and removing. I have used many functions in this project. These functions are easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective operations.
